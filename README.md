## Problem Statement
The Challenge - In an era where health awareness is growing, individuals increasingly seek personalized nutrition guidance. However, most existing tools provide generic diet plans, lack real-time adaptability, and fail to consider a person's holistic lifestyle, cultural preferences, allergies, and evolving health conditions. Furthermore, dieticians and nutritionists face limitations in scaling personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints.
 
Proposed Solution - Generative AI presents a groundbreaking opportunity to revolutionize this space by enabling an intelligent, interactive, and adaptive virtual nutrition assistant. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), multimodal understanding, and large-scale dietary databases, an AI-powered assistant can generate dynamic meal plans, recommend smart food swaps, and explain nutritional choices‚Äîall tailored to the individual.
